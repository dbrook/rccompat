Installation instructions for RCcompat
--------------------------------------

Requirements
------------
RCcompat (as of release 2) requires C++ and Qt runtime libraries. This project
was compiled using mingw32 with Qt linking to it. As such, the following files
should be kept in the same directory as the executable in order to best harness
the dynamic linking environment in Windows:

  QtCore4.dll, QtGui4.dll, libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll, libstdc++-6.dll, mingwm10.dll

In Linux or MacOS, it's assumed that the Qt libraries are already present.

Due to limitations with MinGW, RCcompat is a 32-bit application, but it works
in 64-bit Windows just the same.


Installation
------------
If you've grabbed the already-built version of RCcompat, this is very simple.
Copy the RCcompat3 directory's contents wherever you'd like (say, a network
drive or "Program Files"). Then on (the/each) workstation, navigate to this
location and right click the RCcompat3 executable and drag to wherever you'd
like the shortcut to appear. Upon releasing the button, you'll get a menu and
choose "Create Shortcut Here".

TODO: In Linux: create a script to make an entry in /usr/share/application as
                well as copy the binary (and icon) to /opt/RCcompat/...

      In MacOS: I don't have a Mac, but surely at some point I can figure out
                how to make a DMG or something that can be dragged to Apps.


Configuration File
------------------
There is a provided appConfig.ini file which holds the settings of RCcompat as
of version 3. In Windows, this file should be kept in the same directory as the
RCcompat3 executable. Whomever "owns" the file is the one who will be able to
access the RCcompat3 > Configuration... menu within the application, all others
will get a permissions error. This is useful in a multi-user environment where
you wouldn't want this arbitrarily changed.

(In reality, this is simply obeying the Windows file permissions before
running the configuration dialog in the application, so if you want multiple
people to be able to change it, you'll have to manually change the attributes
of appConfig.ini)

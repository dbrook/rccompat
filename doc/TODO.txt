TODO List
---------

	- Do something to override the default QSettings file such that
	  it behaves better across operating systems. Right now, the
	  QSettings file goes (on Windows) wherever the application .exe
	  is located and on Linux/Mac it will go in the current working
	  directory (likely the user's home directory) when run.

  Version         		Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.0   - released January 13, 2012.
		Complete rewrite (still in Qt/C++) but to make the code much more
		maintainable in the future. This release also has better widget layout
		mechanisms done "the Qt way" that allow the interface to scale properly
		if an end user desires larger/smaller fonts as configured in their O.S.
		Because of these changes, the program is now completely portable to 
		Windows, GNU/Linux, and MacOS to allow as much flexibility as possible.
		The final improvement was to simplify the amount of interaction required
		to get a calculation result; now the results are updated as the user
		goes through and makes selection.

Version 2.2   - released July 13, 2012.
		Fixed the bug where resetting the Rh Factor radio buttons wasn't 
		implemented. This involved using a little hack in the UI code to 
		un-bind the radio buttons from each other and then recombining them.

Version 2.1   - released June 22, 2012.
		Cleaned up a memory leak problem with the about window by using the C++ 
		delete operator in the closeEvent member function and binding the
		accept() and reject() signals to that close() slot. The memory leaks
		were previously occurring when using Escape to close the window.

Version 2.0   - released June 3, 2012.
		Completely rewritten in Qt/C++.
		This allowed for the use of buttons that could be toggled rather than
		check-buttons. This made indications of which antigens are selected
		a great deal clearer. 
		Per-request, the selectable antigens requiring patient race were 
		eliminated, which resulted in a simpler interface.

Version 1.0   - released May 25, 2012.
		Written in Tcl/Tk and required special packaging for running on Windows,
		ran on Linux with very little effort but resultant Windows binaries were
		just too large. Additionally some rather poor programming practices were
		implemented just to get the tool off the ground and tested. It worked, 
		but the author didn't feel very great about it.

Red Cell Compatibility Calculator for Blood Banking

This project wasn't originally hosted on GitHub, hence the lack of
commits in the logs.

A good set of instructions and other information about the program
can be found on my website:

  http://www.danbrook.org/rccompat.html

If you're a Linux user and would like to try it out, you'll need the
Qt development files installed to run 'qmake' and 'make' to build the
application after cloning the repository.

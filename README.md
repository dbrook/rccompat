Red Cell Compatibility Calculator for Blood Banking

This project wasn't originally hosted on GitHub, hence the lack of
commits in the logs.

If you're a Windows user looking to just run the application, I've
packaged up the appropriate DLLs and EXE here:

  http://www.cs.uml.edu/~dbrook/rccompat_win.zip

If you're a Linux user and would like to try it out, you'll need the
Qt development files installed to run 'qmake' and 'make' to build the
application after cloning the repository.
